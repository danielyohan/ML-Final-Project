## Malware Detection using ML techniques

As part of our introuduction to ML course, our objective involved distinguishing between malware infected files and clean files. <br>
We were provided with a table listing file attributes. Employing machine learning methods like a simple NN and AdaBoost for classification, the best model achieved an AUC score of 0.97 on the validation set. <br>
train = 60000 <br>
test (no label) = 18000 <br>
validation = 12000
